## Assignment (CSE4001): Installing the CSE4001 Docker Container

In this assignment, you will set up the **OS/161** operating system on your personal computer using the provided Docker environment. This setup will be used for all subsequent OS/161-related assignments in the course.

Follow the instructions provided in the link below to install and run OS/161:

- [Installing OS/161](https://github.com/eraldoribeiro/UsingCSE4001_OS161)

Once OS/161 is running, you must make a small modification to the kernel, rebuild it, and boot the updated kernel to verify your change.

### Required Kernel Change

1. Search the OS/161 kernel source code for the string:

   ```
   Put-your-group-name-here
   ```

2. Replace this string with **your name**.

3. Rebuild the kernel.

4. Boot OS/161 and confirm that the updated boot sequence displays your name.

## Deliverables

- Update this `README.md` file to include **a screenshot** showing OS/161 successfully booting with your name visible in the boot output.
- The screenshot must be:
  - A valid image format (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.gif`)
  - Uploaded to this repository
  - Properly displayed in this README using Markdown image syntax. Once you commit the changes, reload the repository on GitHub to ensure that the screenshot figure renders properly. 

### Screenshot Guidelines

The goal is to quickly and clearly verify that the assignment tasks were completed. Capture a single screenshot that shows the OS/161 boot output with your name visible.

## Screenshots

> **Replace the placeholder below with your own screenshot.**

The image below is **only an example** demonstrating how to embed an image in Markdown.
 To include your actual screenshot:

1. Replace the example image filename with your own screenshot filename.
2. Ensure the image file is added to this repository so GitHub can render it correctly.
